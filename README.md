This is an unofficial complete agenda for SUSECON Digital 2022 that I've created for my own use but others may find useful.

It's basically the official [SUSECON Digital 2022 agenda](https://susecon.com/agenda.html) combined with the [available sessions](https://www.susecon.com/sessions.html) (as of Monday 6 June 18:30 BST) with a page for each day:

[Day 1: Tuesday 7 June](day1.md)

[Day 2: Wednesday 8 June](day2.md)

[Day 3: Thursday 9 June](day3.md)

SUSECON Digital 2022 takes place online and is [free to attend](https://reg.rainfocus.com/flow/suse/susecon22/registration/login?utm_source=SimonTwitter&utm_medium=Social&utm_campaign=Collective), either in real-time or after the event "on demand".
