This is an unofficial complete agenda for SUSECON Digital 2022 that I've created for my own use but others may find useful.

It's basically the official [SUSECON Digital 2022 agenda](https://susecon.com/agenda.html) merged with the [sessions](https://www.susecon.com/sessions.html) with a page for each day: [Day 1](day1.md) [Day 2](day2.md) [Day 3](day3.md)

SUSECON Digital 2022 takes place online from Tuesday 7 June through Thursday 9 June is free to attend, either in real-time or after the event "on demand".
