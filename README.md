This is an unofficial complete agenda for SUSECON Digital 2022 that I've created for my own use but others may find useful.

It's basically the official [SUSECON Digital 2022 agenda](https://susecon.com/agenda.html) merged with the [sessions](https://www.susecon.com/sessions.html) with a page for each day:
[Day 1: Tuesday 7 June](day1.md)
[Day 2: Wednesday 8 June](day2.md)
[Day 3: Thursday 9 June](day3.md)

SUSECON Digital 2022 takes place online and is free to attend, either in real-time or after the event "on demand".
